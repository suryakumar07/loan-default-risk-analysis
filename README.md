# loan-default-risk-analysis

## Problem Statement
This project aims to explore loan default risks using exploratory data analysis (EDA). By identifying patterns and factors influencing default, the analysis helps financial institutions make better lending decisions.

## Business Objectives
- Identify driving factors behind loan default.
- Use insights to minimize financial risks while ensuring business growth.

## Project Structure
- **Credit_EDA_Case_Study.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook containing the exploratory data analysis.
- **Credit_EDA_Case_Study.pdf**: A document summarizing the project details and findings.

## About the Data
The dataset includes information on loan applications and repayment history, enabling the study of borrower attributes and loan performance.

The dataset includes three key files:

application_data.csv: Contains all the information provided by the client at the time of application. This includes data related to whether a client has experienced payment difficulties.

previous_application.csv: Contains information about the clientâ€™s previous loan data, detailing whether the previous application was Approved, Cancelled, Refused, or if an offer was Unused.

columns_description.csv: A data dictionary that describes the meaning of the variables used across the other datasets.
